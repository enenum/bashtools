BashTools

The idea of bashtools came to me after I found myself setting up so many bash shells and thought it's better to have all the scripts in one place so I can just pull them to the machine I need them on.

getmp3folder.sh - downloading an mp3 album or messages. First argument is the URL. It puts the files in the current directory. Make sure that is what you want. Second argument can change the extension from the default mp3. Don't include the dot.
